trna.general.descr        : text file of general descriptor for finding tRNA genes.
general_descr_fig.eps     : EPS file pictorally depicting the general descriptor.
EcoliO157:H7.032301.fastn : FASTN file of E. coli O157:H7 genome, obtained
			    from NCBI on 3/23/01.
run_rnamotif              : shell script for running RNAMOTIF using the general
                            descriptor and searching the E. coli O157:H7 genome.
			    Also includes steps to clean up the results.
*.save			  : saved output files for comparison


The "rnamotif" executable outputs a "raw" data file in which the sequences are not
aligned.  The "rmfmt" executable cleans this up, producing a file in which the 
sequences are aligned to each other using the secondary structures queried in the
descriptor, and the results are sorted using the score.

Some sequences appear multiple times because there are different ways of arranging
certain nucleotides that would all fit the descriptor.  The duplicate sequences
can be removed by "extract_seq_info".  The command-line argument "low" (optional)
keeps the arrangement of a sequence with the lowest-score.
