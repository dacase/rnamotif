Installation and testing of rnamot3:

(a)  Edit the "config.h" file in this directory to suit your local 
     environment.  This may require no change on many machines, but
     you may need to locate the C-compiler, lex or yacc.

(b)  "make" will make the executables, leaving them in the src subdirectory.

(c)  "make test" will run some (short) test suites.

Please send comments and questions to Tom Macke <macke@scripps.edu>.
