a given descriptor or "motif".  Matching sequences can also be ranked by
various scoring functions.  See doc/rnamot.ps for documentation.

Installation and testing of rnamotif:

(a)  Edit the "config.h" file in this directory to suit your local 
     environment.  This may require no change on many machines, but
     you may need to locate the C-compiler, lex or yacc, and set compiler
     flags.

(b)  Now "make" will make the executables, leaving them in the src
	 subdirectory.  There is no "install" target, but (after you run the
     test suite) you can manually move "rnamotif", "rmfmt", "rm2ct" and 
     "rmprune" to someplace in your PATH if you wish.

(c)  "make test" will run some test calculations and report results.
