3.1.1   2015-may-12
    Re-do how logging is done

3.1.0	2015-apr-28
    Fixed bug in find_pknot3 that ignored certain bases

3.0.7   2010-apr-03
    Update grammar to work with bison 2.4.1; fixed some -Wall warnings

3.0.6   2010-mar-13
    Avoid a name collision with the getline() routine in some stdio.h headers

3.0.4   2005-jan-24
    Minor fixup to config.h to tell people to get an up-to-date version
    of bison; plus a corresponding fix to the grammar.

3.0.3	2004-apr-14
	Added #include <malloc.h> to every source file that uses malloc(),
	calloc(), etc.  

	Also added proto or mm_regdup() to mm_regexp.h, and
	#include mm_regexp.h to compile.c  as this might be the cause of
	the core dump J Smith reported

3.0.2	2004-mar-24
	Added a new line #RM dfile <descr-file-name> to the header of the
	output.  Requested by Chris Fields <cjfields@uiuc.edu>
	
3.0.1	2003-nov-10
	Modified rmlex.l to treat \r as white space.

	Added code to mrnamotif.c to collect worker rnamotif errors
	and report them back to the rank-0 process using messages of
	MT_ERROR.

3.0.0	2003-jul-27
	Modified the score section to allow "carry around" variables.  
	This allows users to write descriptors that can remember the
	SCORE of previous candiates which allows them to limit the output
	to a more global "best" solution.

2.4.1	2003-jun-18
	Fixed bug in compile.c that never bothered to load float variables
	in str-element parameter settings.  IE pairfrac=PF, where PF is a
	float valued variable didn't do anything.  Result, the assignments
	were skipped.

	Fixed bug in compile.c that never converted between int/float in
	parm (str-element) keywords.  

	Fixed bug! This is a stretch whereby an extremely long sequence
	would defeat the the seq. buf overflow check because the counter
	itself overflowed!  Really.  Somebody tried to pipe a TEN BILLION
	nt randeom seq to rnamotif and at 30,000,000 it stopped filling 
	the buffer, but 2^31 the cnt went <0 and buffer filling restarted
	producing ... ugly.  Now check for 32 bit in overflow in addition
	to buffer size, so there!

	Added new flag -la to rmfmt.  Acts just like -l except the single
	ID is the ACC# instead of the LOCUS name.  Left -l in because all
	the tests are based on it.

2.4.0	2003-feb-25
	Improved the MPI driver so that -v, -s work without other options;
	-c works so that no search is done; -v, -s, -c do not require data.
	Also added 2 options -pre Cmd, -post Cmd that will insert Cmd 
	before/after the worker rnamotif cmd allowing pre/post processing
	in the search.  -pre gets both the -fmt X values and the file
	name.  The Cmds must be in your path.

	Moved all prototypes of visible rnamotif functions to rnamot.h.
	Fixed grammar to use a union on the parse stack to hold either
	an int (simple values) or a parse tree.  Should be ready for 
	64 bit addressing now!

2.3.4	2003-jan-20
	Added code to allow the user to set the size of the maximum input
	sequence length via the -N size option.  Still defaults to 30000000.
	Also (finally) added code to create the rev. comp in situ when the
	user asks to search both strands

2.3.3	2002-nov-29
	added new score builtin substr() which operates on strings.
	replaced all calls to tempnan() with mkstemp().
	moved the long case elements in do_scl() into their own funcs.

2.3.2	2002-nov-24
	Increase line buffer size in mrnamotif.c:rn_run() so as to not split
	any long results.

	Fixed off by 1 error in the job count logic in mrnamotif.c

2.3.1	2002-oct-07
	Simplified mrnamotif.  Use MPI_Bcast() instead of MPI_Send() to
	set up the searches.  Mapping of search db into actual files is now
	done via the FMmark_active().

2.3.0	2002-sep-26
	mrnamotif now actually running faster than serial.  A bug in 
	RM_getags(): atof() undeclared, resulted in optimization being
	off for the parallel version, but on for the serial version.

2.2.3	2002-sep-13
	First parallel version: mrnamotif and MPI driver that will run
	serrial rnamotif on a set of n/w hosts.  Supports both local and
	distributed file systems.

2.2.2	2002-aug-17
	Added to insure that efn()/efn2() are not used on pknots or on 
	out of bounds bp's that may be involved to do trying to compute
	the energy of partial structures.

	Resolved inconsistant declaration of rm_wdfname from char [] to
	char *.  This was causing a very mysterious core dump in the 
	efn_drv.c program.

2.2.1	2002-aug-11
	Added code sent by Martin Larose <larosem@IRO.UMontreal.CA> to rm2ct
	allowing it to product either relaxed .ct files (-t rnamotif, default)
	or strict .ct files as required by rnaviz (-t rnaviz)

2.2.0	2002-jun-12
	Moved the most basic defs (TRUE, FALSE, UNDEF, input file types) to
	rmdefs.h to facilitate sharing dbutil.c with other rnamotif processing
	programs

	Fixed bug in FN_fgetseq() that caused it read the 1st seq line as 
	the seq def if the def line was > id (spaces), ie, id with no def
	and trailing spaces.

2.1.4	2002-may-12
	Added ability to read GB flat files.

	Fixed bug that sometimes generated a 'syntax' error from cmdline
	defs, ie -DN=V entries.

2.1.3	2002-apr-11
	Added new score builtin: loc() which takes a single str-element
	paramter and returns the actual position (5' = 1) of the 1st
	nt in that str-element.  The element must have matched a non-zero
	len string.  The position is always wrt to the current 5' end,
	which is reversed when the the comp. seq is searched.

2.1.2	2002-mar-08
	Fixed bug in strict2attr() that used the same attribute for both 3
	and 5 strictness.

2.1.1	2002-feb-15
	Extended control over strict helix checking to individual ends of
	individual helices.

	Fixed bug that required that ends= be in the 1st element of a
	structural group.

2.1.0	2002-feb-06
	Re-added, ie uncommented and updated the "strict helices" feature.
	Set by -sh on the cmd line, it was in the original release.  This
	feature rejets solutions where any helix could be extended into a
	surrounding ss region.

2.0.2	2002-jan-07
	Fixed bug in optimizer that allowed right end of the search region
	to extend past the end of the sequence.

2.0.1   2001-dec-20
	Added a section to the Users' Manual explaining the new optimizations.

2.0.0	2001-dec-19
	Added query optimization that looks for the best fixed subpattern among
	the seq=, and if this sub pat is long enough, has a bounded prefix and
	optimization is on, searches each seq in the DB for instances of this
	subpattern then for each such instance seaches the appropriate
	containing region for instances of the entire pattern.  Fast!

1.7.1   2001-nov-29
	Updated Users' Manual to include references and information about
	efn() and efn2()

1.7.0	2001-oct-29
	First version with efn2(), a score builtin that evaluates the
	improved, coaxial stacking Turner rules.

	Fixed bug in rmfmt that failed to insert a space before multi-column
	scores.

1.6.3	2001-oct-03
	Fixed bug in efn() that incorrectly indexed tetraloops.

	Fixed bug in setupefn() that used rm_descr[] instead of 
	rm_xdescr[] to get the ref'd descriptors.

	Fixed bug in bits() that used the wrong log conversion
	constant.
	
1.6.2	2001-sep-10
	Collected all e-params used in efn() into a structure, EFNDATA_T
	which will make it relatively easy to do DNA and T != 37 calcs.

	Fixed bug (oversight) in efn() that allows for uninitialized
	array indexes in 1x2 loops.  

	Added 2d meaning of builtin fncn mismatches().  Takes 2 
	args, a string and a pattern and evaluates the number of
	mismatches between the string and the pattern.  Original
	function with one argument is unchanged.

1.6.1	2001-aug-24
	Added new function bits() to the score.  Function computes the 
	compositional complexity of a subsequence of the current match.
	Was suggested by a reviewer who thought it might be a useful
	proxy for `fitness'
		
	Redid sequence file handling, replacing fastn.c with dbutil.c
	New code also permits pir input (ie title line between the >-line
	and the first seq. line.)

1.6.0	2001-jul-31
	Finished first version of context.  ctx() behaves like any ss()
	with the same parms, except they are checked after the motif has
	been found.
	
1.5.98	2001-jun-29
	Initial implementation of context.  Sites work, but score doesn't
	Context length and sequence are not checked but stubs are in for this.

1.5.3	2001-jun-03
	Fixed bug that used too short of a buffer for RE's with 
	many character classes.

1.5.2	2001-may-31
	Fixed that treated 0-length seqs as EOF in FN_fgetseq().

1.5.1	2001-may-28
	Fixed bug that limited RE's with mismatches to one character 
	class.
	Fixed bug that had the continue stmt branch to the loop test instead
	of the loop increment.

	Added code to allow break N; and continue N; where N is an integer
	indicating the number of loops to break out of or continue.  Optional
	in which case N == 1.  N must be in [1,LD] where LD is the loop depth.

1.5.0	2001-apr-23
	First public release.  No changes from 1.4.3, but now includes a 
	user manual!

1.4.3	2001-mar-28
	Fixed bug (used =, instead ==) in a loop that blitzed the bp array
	during an eval of efn().  Apparantly only occuring rarely as it was
	caught by the pknot test code that checks to see if a substructure
	is improperly nested.  Hurrah for defensive programming!

	Added new filter program rmprune that removes some redundant hits
	from the output.  Redundant hits are those that have variable
	length stem and the hits differ only the stem being shorter.  Only
	the longest such hit is kept.

1.4.2	2001-feb-07
	Reactivated the heartbeat: -Dshow_progress=N, N > 0, will write
	a line containing the entry count and entry sid for ecnt % N == 0.

	Made some small changes to rmfmt for use on a farm.  Added options to
	allow user to set the temp dir for the temp files as well as set an
	upper bound on the size of the file that will be sorted for -l.

	Modified command line processing to permit use of multiple DB's for
	rnamotif:

		rnamotif -descr X.descr nt.fastn est.fastn ...

1.4.1	2001-jan-18
	Added code to facilitate use on a farm.  In particular allow the
	user to specify the expanded (ie included and cmd-line defs) output
	file which will be recompiled on the farms boxes.  Use -xdescr 
	instead of -descr to indicate no preprocessing.

1.4.0	2000-dec-17
	Added include capabilities to permit file sharing.  Includes 
	are indicated with #include 'xxx' lines in the source and may
	be nested to a depth (including the 1st file) of 10.  The
	argument to the include should be a single or angle (<>) quoted
	string, as to be consistant double quoted strings are considered
	to be sequences and any IUPAC chars are expanded.

	Following the C example, 0 or more -Idir arguments may be
	placed on the command line are the names of directories to be
	searched in left to right order to find the include files.

	Including is handled by a separate 1st pass over the original
	source and it along with the includes are writen to a tmp file
	which is then rescanned by lex/yacc.  Line/file info from the
	original source is saved as # line N 'xxx' directives.  This
	mod also allowed the command line defs to be interpolated just
	before the descr res. word giving the correct semantics that
	command line defs take effect before any searching.

1.3.4	2000-nov-29
	Added new builtin sprintf() which works like the awk version.
	It takes 1+ args, the first of which is a format, and the 2 and
	subsequent are arguments to be `interpolated' into the format.
	It returns a character string with is usually assigned to the
	predefined variable SCORE.

	Also fixed rmfmt to deal with >1 score columns in light of the
	new ability of rnamotif to create such files.  A single numeric
	SCORE behaves like the previous versions, >1, but fixed score
	fields is sorted on name & position only, and >1 but variable is
	not sorted.

1.3.3	2000-nov-15
	Several (tricky) modifications done to permit users to set/reset
	parameters from the cmd line.  The trick was to get the parser to
	look at the sequence of cmd line defs as several potential defs,
	like pairsets are rather complicated.  The solution was to collect
	the defs into a file that is scanned after the descriptor is scanned,
	this having the salutory effect of making cmd-line defs supercede
	the defs in the descr.  To this however, required making a input
	file consisting of entirely a parms section legal, which was done,
	but covered by insisting that the actual descriptor file have a 
	descriptor.  A side effect of all of this was to get about 2/3 of
	the way to allowing includes.

	Fixed oversight in compile.eval() that disallowed negates!

1.3.2	2000-oct-29
	Fixed bug that caused core dump when using empty sequence "".  
	Problem didn't affect strings ('').

	Implemented string concatentation (+, +=).

1.3.1	2000-oct-11
	Fixed memory leak that lost the memory holding the tag in a 
	tagged stref (eg h5['h1'])

	Replaced interated efn() with a nice clean recursive version.

	Added code to activate using $, expr's inside struct elements in
	scoring rules.

1.3.0	2000-sep-26
	Fixed the memory leak in do_ior() and do_and() that lost the
	memory of a string value arg: if( s1 && s2 ) or if( s1 || s2 )
	where s1 and s2 are strings, the memory holding the string 
	value is lost after the op. 

1.2.99	2000-sep-10
	Added code that applies the turner energy rules to the selected
	substructure.  The turner data is distribute with rnamotif in
	the subdirectory ../efndata.  rnamotif first looks to the value
	of the parm `efn_datadir' and if not '' uses this value as the
	location of the Turner data.  However, if this value is '', then
	rnamotif uses the value of the env. var EFNDATA.  If this is not
	set, rnamotif prints a message that it can't find the efndata,
	and any call to efn() returns a 0.

	Turner rules are really only for wc+gu, although it is possible
	to say that any two base are paired.  However, this is dangerous,
	and probably incorrect as well, and in some case will return an
	`infinite' value of 160.0 (?)  Nonetheless, rnamotif, provides
	two additional symbols `efn_usestdbp' and `efn_stdbp'. The first
	is an int with default value 1, and if !0 says tha the the proposed
	base pair must be in the pairset efn_stdbp in order to consider it
	paired for efn().  If efn_usestdbp is 0, then base pairs are set
	according to the the pairset associated with the current helix.
	Again, if this pairset is not wc or wc+gu, you are playing with fire
	and the results are likely to be wrong!

	Finally, a small, but useful change.  I added a new option to the
	cmd line: -s which prints in the names of the global parms and their
	default values:

		rnamot -s
		PARMS:  16 global symbols.
		wc               = { "a:u", "c:g", "g:c", "u:a" }
		gu               = { "g:u", "u:g" }
		 .
		 .
		 .
		efn_usestdbp     = 1
		efn_stdbp        = { "a:u", "c:g", "g:c", "g:u", "u:a", "u:g" }

	and then exits with value 0. (Normal)  I did this because I could
	remember all those parameters and got tired of haveing to look at
	the source just to change something!
 
1.2.7	2000-jul-17
	Fixed faulty logic that incorrectly evaluated the range of an RE,
	ie, the \{n,m\} construct as its maxlen.  Ridid the code that 
	found the lengths of the elements from the various *len and seq
	parameters.

1.2.6	2000-jun-13
	Added code to accept 0-length W/C helices. Since a countably
	infinite number of such helices surround every base, there use
	must be judicious or you are going to find all sorts of stuff!

1.2.5	2000-jun-11
	Fixed bug that treated '\0' as a legit mismatch in string compares.

	Redid rmfmt to produce alignements of rnamot output in fastn format
	if the -a swicth is set. 

1.2.4	2000-apr-27
	Fixed bugs in pairfrac calc's that 1) created the mplim 1 less than
	it was supposed to be and 2) had problems with float division in
	which 1.*(hl-mpr)/hl is NOT pairfrac even thought mathematically it
	is.  Fixed 1 with addition of .5 before assignment to int mplim and
	fixed 2 by checking for < pairfrac - EPS (1e-6)

	Redid score section to permit indexing over all descriptors:

		for( i = 1; i <= NSE; i++ )
			SCORE += mispairs( ss[i] );

	Although the original implementation didn't permit things like
	h5['name',p,l], based on a comment from Ranga, put it in. 

1.2.3	2000-mar-31
	Fixed bug in fastn.c that failed to convert u's in the input to t's.

1.2.2	2000-mar-28
	Implemented <pair> in <pairset>:
	
		s = h5[1,i,1]:h3[3,len-i+1,1] in {"g:c","c:g"};

	These two operations, : and in were the only op's unimplemented
	from the original rnamotif design, thus this release completes
	that design (Hoorah!)

	Also added new operation of [] which is an indexed ref to the
	substring of the current match that is associated with the 
	specified descriptor. One to three parameters are allowed which
	are the id, (a string or int), the pos (int valued) and the lenght,
	also (int valued.)  One parameter is id, two is id,pos and three
	is id,pos,len. h5[1] is the entire matrch, h5[1,2] is the string
	from 2 to its end and h5[1,2,3] is 3 chars beginnin at 2.

	Also removed from the grammar the implied list of strings:

		s = e1:e2:...:eN;

	which can now only occur in the context of a site, either in the
	site section or in the score section.

1.2.1	2000-mar-19
	Replaced incorrect greedy match_wchlx() that returned only the
	longest helix in the interval [minlen,maxlen] with correct code
	that returns a vector of all helices in the interval [minlen,maxlen].

	Extended input language to accept single quote string 'xxx' as well
	as double quote strings "xxx".  Single quote strings are uninterpreted
	except for the usual C escapes (\t,\n,\f,\',\ooo, etc).  Double quote
	strings however are DNA-sequences and all are forced to lower, all u's
	are converted to t's and the iupac codes are converted into the 
	equivalent RE's (n = .; r = [ag], etc).  

	Implemented the match/don't match operator in the score section.
	Changed the grammar so that the in operator is always site in pairset,
	so it looks just like site.  This operator is not yet implemented.

1.2.0   2000-feb-09
	Removed restriction on pknots that limited them to two helices. This
	required modifications to both the compile phase (compile.c) and
	the search phase (find_motif.c)  The new search algorithm fixes an
	(apparantly) overlooked bug in the old search algorithm that joined
	the loop over the 3' end of the 1st helix with the 3' end of the 
	region in which the pknot must be found.  The new algorithm correctly
	treats these loops as independent; as a result many more pknots are
	found.

	Also redid fastn.c to read fastn records char by char rather than
	line by line.  The original line by line method incorrectly handled
	defintion lines that were longer than the line buf.  The new fastn.c
	routine adds chars from the def line to line buf until line buf is
	full, then discards the rest of the def line with a message to stderr
	that the def line was XXXX chars long and was truncated to TTTT chars.

	Fixed bug that considered the descriptor score indexes to be on the
	interval [0,n_descr) to put them on the correct interval [1,n_descr]

	Finally, added new builtin symbol 'show_progress' which is normally
	0, but when set to 1 will print the name of each entry as it is read
	by the main loop.  I added it to make sure that the new pknot finder
	which is slower than the old one was actually working!

1.1.1	1999-nov-08
	Modified helix finding codes to allow a helix to begin and/or end with
	a mismatch.  This is normally off, but may be turned on at two levels:
	If the *_ends variable (* = {wc, phlx, tr, qu}) is set its value becomes
	the default end condition for all helices of the specified type.  The
	values of these variables are the strings "pp", "pm", "mp" and "mm"
	(case doesn't matter) which mean 5'&3' paired; 5' paired, 3' mispair OK;
	5' mispair OK, 3' paired; and mispairs OK at either or both 5'&3'.  Note
	that mispairs are not required, just permitted.  To select for a mispair
	at that position use the score section.  The default value is "pp".  In
	addition, the ends may be specified at the str-el level using the ends=
	parameter.  This uses the same values as the global symbols, but the
	scope is limited to that str-el.

1.1.0	1999-oct-23
	Added builtins mispairs(), mismatches() and paired() to score
	system.

	Added new variables NSE (number of structure elements) and SCORE.
	NSE is used to loop over the descr elements.
	SCORE is used to hold the value of the candidate's score and is
	printed by print_match() when the candidate is acccepted.

1.0.5	1999-oct-08
	Added code to implement pairfrac to the p*, h*, t* and q*
	structure elements.

	First released version that has a working score system.  Scoring
	system can examine subseqeunces of the sequences that match the
	descriptor elements for the current match candidate.

1.0.4	1999-sep-28
	Added float parms pairfrac & matchfrac to strels.  Reorganized 
	eval() to use the scheme (T_IJ()) used in score().

	Fixed bug that was setting the offset to the matched string in the
	3' part of wc-hlx to the 3' most base instead of the 5' most base.

1.0.3	1999-sep-10
	Added awk-like score section to the grammar & lex input.  Currently
	score takes no action.

	Changed input slightly:
		1. the = between the sites and the pairset is now required
		   to be the res. word "in"
		2. parameter defs must now end with semicolon.

	Fixed bug that was checking if the outermost w/c helix could be
	extended.

	Fixed bug that assumed no spaces between the > and the id in a fastn
	file.

1.0.2	1999-sep-03
	Added code to section that checks for seq= matches that converts
	any u's in the input data to t's allowing it work on rna as well as
	dna data.

	fixed (apparantly) unreported bug that stopped checking an sites,
	as the chk_site() code was called by chk_motif() which was commented
	out as chk_motif() was too strict

1.0.1	1999-aug-27
	Reformatted output for fastn input to include 2 lines
	for each hit. Line 1 is the `def' line from the fastn
	file (must begin with >) and line 2 is the sequence
	as before except that the name is now the 1st word
	minus the > of the fastn line

	Also fixed bug in find_triplex() that computed the 
	length of the 2d interior as 1 too small.

1.0.0	1999-aug-03
	First working version that included all the features.
