I looked over the 6 letter descriptors for the Pknot and the hairpin and 
agree that they do describe the two structures:

	SHIHLJIJS	is a hairpin on a stem with an internal loop

	SHIHIJIJS	is a pseudoknot

If my understanding of the descriptors is correct:

	HLJ		indicates that H & J are paired
	HIJ		indicates that H & J are NOT paired

In the two examples above, the application of these rules produces a single
structure.

If the only Pk's are terminal Pk's, then the language appears to be
adequate; however, if Pks are allowed in the non-terminal parts of larger
structures, then the two simple 3-helix structures below would appear to have
the same descriptor.

Consider the structures:

    5'->S-H1-I-H2-I-H3-+
	  :    :    :  L	==>	SHIHIHLJIJIJS		(1)
    3'<-S-J1-I-J2-I-J3-+

    5'->S-H1-I-H2-I-H3-+
      	  :    :    :  |
      +-> : -->J1-S :  L	==>	SHIHIHLJIJIJS		(2)
      |	  :	    :  |
      +-I-J2------I-J3-+

(1) is a hairpin on a stem containing two internal loops
(2) is a hairpin extension of a Pknot.

I agree that such a construct as (2) is contrived, and is extremely unlikely
to exist, but there is a very long Pk in SSU rRNA which encloses ~900 bp
which in turn contains lots of properly nested helices.  If the goal is to
be able to describe *any* rRNA structure ... I don't see any way around
allowing the user to label to the parts in order to override the default
pairing rules.
